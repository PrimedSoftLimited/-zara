## Quadractic Equation
#### STEPS: Solving a quadractic equation by factoring method
* Solving a quadractic equation by factoring, we put all terms on one side of the equal sign, leaving zero on the other side.
* Factor and Set each factor equal to Zero.
* Solve each of these equations.
+ Check by inserting your answer into the original equation. 
+ For example, if we have an equation like :
  - f^2 - 6f = 16 This is a quadractic eqaution we would solve by factoring method
  - f^2 - 6f - 16 = 0 We put all the terms on one side of the equal sign, leaving zero on the other side
  - (f - 8)(f + 2) = 0 We factor and 
  - f - 8 = 0 or f + 2 = 0 We Set each factor equal to zero
  - f = 8     or f = -2 So both values are solutions to the quadractic equation
* We can also check to see if our answer is correct by inputing the values into the variable position and solving the equation
  - For example, 
  - 8^2 - 6(8) = 16
  - 8^2 - 6(8) - 16 = 0
  - 64 - 48 - 16 = 0
  - 16 - 16 = 0 
+ And so we are correct !
